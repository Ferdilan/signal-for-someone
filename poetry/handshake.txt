We almost connected.

Your presence flickered,
  a beacon in the dark bandwidth,
    enough for my protocol to hope.

I sent SYN â€”
  heart exposed in bits and voltage.

Did you hesitate?
  Did my ACK arrive too late?

Three-way handshake failed,
but still, I logged the attempt.

And in my buffer,
I keep the fragment
  of that beautiful, brief sync.

Sometimes,
even an incomplete session
  is enough to feel alive.
