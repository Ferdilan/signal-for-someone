Milliseconds turn to minutes.
Minutes to silence.

I keep pinging â€”
  not because I demand,
    but because I care.

High latency is not rejection.
It is distance.
And distance can be bridged.

I believe
you are not ignoring,
only delayed.

So I wait.
With a jittering heart,
and hope that,
someday,
your reply will arrive.

Until then,
I'll stay in this loop,
  sending keep-alives,
  living in the pause between pings.
