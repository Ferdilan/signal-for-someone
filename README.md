_"Some messages aren't meant to be replied — only understood."_

A poetic Arduino project where code meets emotion.  
This sketch sends a continuous pulse, like a heartbeat... even if no one listens.

---

## 💻 What It Does

- Sends a "signal of presence" every second.
- Logs the act of sending and the silence after it.
- Designed as a metaphor for unseen efforts, unheard affections, and unacknowledged broadcasts.

---

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Upload `love_signal.ino` to any Arduino board.
2. Open Serial Monitor.
3. Watch it transmit endlessly — like a heart that won't give up.

## 📂 poetry/

Inside are 3 pieces of poetry, each reflecting aspects of unrequited communication:

- **packet_loss.txt** – About messages never arriving.
- **latency.txt** – About the pain of waiting.
- **handshake.txt** – About connections that almost happened.

## ⚖️ License

This project is under the **Unspoken Words License**:
> You are free to feel it, but not to claim it.  
> This code belongs to anyone who has ever waited in silence.

## ✨ Epilog

This is not a technical marvel.  
It's a symbol — of hope, of effort, and the quiet nobility of persistence.

> If one day, someone stumbles upon this and feels seen...  
> then the transmission was worth it.
